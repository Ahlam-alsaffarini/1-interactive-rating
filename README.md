## Overview

### The challenge

This a challenge for build Interactive rating component which user should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

When I first started learning JavaScript it used to be very a hard to understand how to interact with DOM elements. With time, it's getting much easier and I am happy to practice it one more time!

yeah it's still some of my working on proj not a professional ,but i hope in future to become stronger and more creative in writing codes
